//! Mental model (the user's framing): **compass / backlog are task SOURCES**
//! ("what should I do next?"), **condukt is the EXECUTOR** ("solve it"), and the
//! `/flow` skill is the loop that binds source → executor. This binary is a
//! thin, subscription-native scaffold (DESIGN: deterministic binary, LLM judges):
//! its only job is the SessionStart `propose` hook that, every session, tells the
//! agent to surface the unified pipeline and proactively offer `/flow` (L2:
//! propose-then-confirm) when there is open work.
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT recompute task counts — compass `nudge`, backlog
//! `session-start`, and condukt `restore` already inject their own state into
//! the SessionStart context. `propose` just adds the directive that ties them
//! together. The hook never breaks a turn: it only writes to stdout and exits 0.

[flow] A unified task pipeline is available this session:
  • SOURCE   — compass (the next right-sized move) and backlog (the open queue)
  • EXECUTOR — condukt (fugu-router routes each task's model)
  • DRIVER   — the /flow skill binds source → executor in a loop.

At the start of THIS session, read the compass / backlog / condukt state already
surfaced above. IF any open work exists (a compass next move, open backlog items,
or an unfinished condukt run), then BEFORE other work, proactively ask the user —
with a SINGLE AskUserQuestion — whether to run `/flow` to drive that work now.
Summarize what is queued (e.g. \"backlog: N open; condukt: run X unfinished\") in
the question. If the user declines, or there is no open work, proceed normally and
do not raise /flow again unless asked.
