# Keep the installed plugin cache in step with this repo's plugin source.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   `crates/condukt/` is the single source of truth: the marketplace ships it via
#   `git-subdir`, and `/plugin install` copies it to
#   `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<owner>/condukt/<version>/` as a PLAIN COPY (no .git).
#   The running /condukt skill loads its agents + SKILL.md from that cache. So when
#   you improve condukt itself, it is tempting to edit the cache copy — but those
#   edits live outside git and silently diverge from the repo (exactly the drift
#   this script exists to prevent). Always edit the repo, then run this to refresh
#   your local install; never hand-edit the cache.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/sync-plugin-assets.sh            # repo -> cache (refresh local install)
#   scripts/sync-plugin-assets.sh --check    # report drift, exit 1 if any (no writes)
#
# Only the text assets the skill loads (agents/, skills/, hooks/) are synced —
# binaries are produced by build-plugin-bin.sh, and src/tests are dev-only.
