//! Replan vs escalate-model classifier (phase-4 DoD#1).
//!
//! When a verifier fails a task a second/third time, the `/condukt` skill's
//! reflux loop needs a deterministic answer to "what next?" before it burns
//! another LLM turn deciding: keep retrying with a stronger model, or give up
//! on the current task shape and hand it back to the interpreter for a
//! replan? Two failure shapes make "escalate the model" the wrong move:
//!
//! 1. The worker is **already at the top tier** (`opus`) and still failing —
//!    there is no stronger tier left to escalate to, so retrying with the
//!    same ceiling model would just repeat the failure.
//! 2. The failure **reason itself says the task is mis-scoped** — the
//!    `done_criteria` doesn't match what the task's `touched_files` can
//!    actually deliver. A stronger model cannot implement its way out of a
//!    scope mismatch; the task needs to be re-decomposed.
//!
//! Anything else — an assertion failure, a compile error, a type mismatch —
//! looks like an ordinary implementation bug that a stronger model has a
//! real shot at fixing, so it escalates the model instead.
//!
//! This module is the deterministic core only: given the reflux facts
//! (`reason`, `failed_tests`, `model_tier`) it computes the resolution. No LLM
//! call, no I/O, no clock — pure function of its arguments. How the resolution
//! is *acted on* (spawning a replan vs. re-dispatching a stronger-model worker)
//! is the `/condukt` SKILL orchestration's job, not this module's.
//!
//! phase-4 DoD#2 wires this classifier into the reflux cascade: when
//! [`classify_failure`] resolves to [`Resolution::Replan`],
//! [`build_replan_handoff`] formats the reflux facts into a [`ReplanHandoff`]
//! that explicitly instructs the interpreter to produce a *brand-new*
//! decomposition — a different approach, a different scope — rather than
//! re-running the original decomposition verbatim (which would just
//! reproduce the same failure). The `condukt replan handoff` CLI subcommand
//! (see `main.rs`) exposes this to the `/condukt` skill's cascade, mirroring
//! how `condukt verify digest` exposes `verify::distill_failure`: the
//! FORMATTING here is deterministic Rust, the actual re-decomposition stays
//! the interpreter LLM's job.
