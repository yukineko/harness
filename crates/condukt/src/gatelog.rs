//! The non-interactive question shim: `condukt policy answer`.
//!
//! `policy decide` maps a decision's risk×reversibility×confidence to
//! `auto|escalate|block`. This module turns that verdict into an *answer* to a
//! concrete question so a caller (the condukt/scout/flow skills) can stop
//! relying on the model obeying prose to "skip the AskUserQuestion when
//! autonomous". When the verdict is [`Decision::Auto`] the question is
//! self-answered with its pre-marked recommended option — no human prompt — and
//! the choice is recorded to an append-only decision log for audit. On
//! `Escalate`/`Block` nothing is answered and the caller falls through to a
//! real `AskUserQuestion` (escalate) or refuses (block).
//!
//! The verdict→answer mapping is a pure function ([`answer_outcome`]) so the
//! auto/escalate/exit-code contract is unit-testable without spawning a
//! process, and the log I/O mirrors [`crate::checkpoint`]'s fail-soft
//! append-only journal (a logging failure never breaks a turn).
