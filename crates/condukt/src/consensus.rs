//! Multi-sample self-consistency consensus (backlog task 4481bed6).
//!
//! A single generated implementation lets a task-specific hallucination slip
//! past the verifier: the one candidate the verifier saw is the one the worker
//! wrote, so a shared blind spot survives. Self-consistency (fan-out / voting)
//! counters this by generating **N independent candidate implementations** for
//! the *same* task, verifying each, and taking a **majority vote** over the
//! verdicts. Low agreement is itself a signal — the samples disagree, so the
//! task is under-specified or genuinely hard — and triggers an escalation to a
//! stronger model (`opus`) for a tie-break / redo.
//!
//! This module is the deterministic core: given N verdicts it computes the
//! winning candidate, the agreement rate, and the escalate-to-opus decision.
//! The expensive, generative part (spawning N workers, running N verifiers)
//! lives in the `/condukt` SKILL orchestration and is strictly OPT-IN — see
//! [`Plan`] and the cost guard in `config.rs`.
