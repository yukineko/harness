//! condukt — deterministic orchestration engine for Claude Code.
//!
//! The LLM (the `/condukt` skill + interpreter/worker/verifier agents) does the
//! judgement work: interpret a request, decompose it into tasks, implement and
//! verify each. This binary does the deterministic work the LLM should not
//! eyeball: schedule tasks into parallel/serial batches by file-conflict
//! analysis, manage the git-worktree lifecycle, track run state, and gate
//! completion. Hooks (restore/statusline) never break a turn — they exit 0.
