//! evalkit — offline golden-regression eval harness for Claude Code plugins.
//!
//! `evalkit run` discovers `evals/*.jsonl` golden cases and asserts over each
//! subject — a `file`'s contents (catch a SKILL.md/prompt edit that drops an
//! invariant) or a `cmd`'s stdout+exit (catch a CLI contract regression). It is
//! the *offline* sibling of condukt's online Phase-6 verifier: deterministic,
//! API-key-free, and meant to run as a CI gate and a `/flow` pre-release check.
//!
//! Exit codes: `0` all passed, `1` a real regression, `2` harness error (no
//! cases / unreadable eval files) — so CI distinguishes a regression from a
//! misconfigured path.
//!
//! This is a plain CLI, not a lifecycle hook, so it does not wrap work in
//! `run_hook`: a gate that swallowed its own failures and exited 0 would be
//! worse than useless.
