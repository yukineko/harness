//! harness-core — the single source of truth for the unchanging infrastructure
//! shared across the yukineko Claude Code harness plugins.
//!
//! This crate is a BUILD-TIME dependency only: each plugin links it statically
//! into its self-contained binary, so the distributed `crates/<plugin>/bin/`
//! never references `../harness-core` at runtime.
//!
//! What lives here is the part that MUST be identical in every plugin —
//! especially the parallel-session-safe note store and the never-break-a-turn
//! hook wrapper (see the harness invariants). Plugin-specific domain logic and
//! config/metrics *fields* stay in each plugin crate and compose these.

// never-break-a-turn invariant backstop: the exit-0-on-error guarantee relies on
// std::panic::catch_unwind in hook::run_hook and gate::run_guarded. Under
// panic="abort" catch_unwind is a silent NO-OP and a panicking hook would abort
// the process, breaking the turn. Fail the build loudly instead of silently
// disabling the guarantee. (cfg(panic) predicate is stable since Rust 1.60.)
#[cfg(not(panic = "unwind"))]
