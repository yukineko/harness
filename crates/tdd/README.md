# tdd

> **Test-first gate for Claude Code**, written in Rust.

Agents skip tests, and "test-first" is usually just a claim. `tdd` makes both
**enforced** and **verifiable**:

| Surface | When | Guarantees |
|---|---|---|
| **`tdd gate`** (Stop hook) | every Stop | implementation code can't land **without a test** — a blocked stop feeds the reason back so the agent writes one |
| **`tdd red` / `green` / `verify`** | driven by `/tdd` | **test-first**: `red` requires the tests to *fail* first and records a proof; `green` requires a prior `red` then a *pass*; `verify` confirms RED→GREEN happened |

It is the *test-first* sibling of the harness's other gates:

| Gate | When | Asks |
|---|---|---|
| `precommit-audit` | pre-commit | does the diff obey policy? (static) |
| **`tdd`** | **on Stop / in /tdd** | **was a test written, first?** |
| `donegate` | on Stop | does it actually build & pass? (runs it) |
| `specguard` | on demand | did the impl drift from spec? (LLM) |

No API key. `tdd` is a deterministic Rust binary that reads `git` and spawns the
test command; the LLM labor (writing the test, implementing) runs in your Claude
Code subscription.

## How the Stop gate works

On each stop `tdd gate`:

1. reads the hook JSON from stdin (`session_id`, `cwd`);
2. loads `./tdd.toml` (or `~/.tdd/config.toml`, or language-aware defaults);
3. asks `git` what changed and which lines were **added**;
4. counts *added implementation lines* (impl-glob files, minus test files and
   inline test markers) and looks for **test evidence** (an added `#[test]` /
   `def test_` / `func Test…` / `it(...)`, or a changed file under `tests/`);
5. **impl added + no test** → `{"decision":"block","reason":…}` so Claude writes
   a test and continues; otherwise the stop proceeds.

A per-session attempt counter gives up after `max_attempts` so a stuck agent is
never trapped. Escape hatch: a one-line `.tdd-skip` file in the project root
(consumed once) for genuine refactors/renames/docs. Kill switch: `TDD_DISABLE=1`.

## Test-first proof (`/tdd` skill)

```
/tdd <behaviour you want>
  Phase 1  design the API (stubs: todo!())
  Phase 2  write the tests
  Phase 3  tdd red   --task <id>   →  RED  (must fail)   → .tdd/<id>.red.json
  Phase 4  implement
  Phase 5  tdd green --task <id>   →  GREEN (must pass)  → .tdd/<id>.green.json
  Phase 6  tdd verify --task <id>  →  RED→GREEN verified
```

`tdd red` refuses to record a proof if the tests already pass (that isn't
test-first); `tdd green` refuses without a prior RED proof. The test command
comes from `--cmd`, else `tdd.toml`'s `test_cmd` (default `cargo test`).

## Config & other subcommands

`tdd` reads `./tdd.toml` (trusted projects only — its `test_cmd` is executed
verbatim), else `~/.tdd/config.toml`, else language-aware defaults. Common keys:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | master switch for the gate |
| `max_attempts` | `3` | give up (allow the stop) after N consecutive blocks |
| `reset_after_secs` | `600` | idle gap that resets the attempt counter |
| `min_added_impl_lines` | `1` | added impl lines before a test is required |
| `test_cmd` | `cargo test` | default command for `tdd red` / `tdd green` |
| `proof_dir` | `.tdd` | where RED/GREEN proofs are written |

`impl_globs` / `test_path_globs` / `test_markers` override the language-aware
file/marker defaults. Other subcommands: `tdd status` (show the resolved config +
what the gate would do), `tdd trust` (honor this project's `tdd.toml` `test_cmd`,
untrusted by default), `tdd uninstall` (remove the Stop hook).

## Install

Via the plugin marketplace (wires the Stop hook through `hooks/hooks.json`, with
a 30s timeout, and ships the `/tdd` skill). For non-plugin use: `tdd install`
merges the Stop hook into `~/.claude/settings.json`; `tdd init` writes a starter
`tdd.toml`.
