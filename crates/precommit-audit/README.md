# precommit-audit

A fast, **config-driven pre-commit static audit** that runs the same on
**Linux, macOS, and Windows**. It is a from-scratch Rust port of a PowerShell
pre-commit hook, with all project-specific policy lifted out of the code and into
a TOML file — so the binary itself is generic and reusable across repos.

## What it does

On each invocation it inspects the working set (`git diff HEAD` + untracked
files) and reports findings. Built-in **generic** checks:

| Check | Blocks? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Source changed without a test | yes | configurable source / test patterns |
| Hard-coded IP address | yes | RFC 5737 test-nets & loopback are benign |
| Hard-coded secret (`password = "…"`) | yes | env getters / placeholders allowed |
| Swallowed exception / `\|\| true` | yes | bare `except:`, `except … : pass`, … |
| Duplicate function definition | yes (opt-in) | heuristic shared-code reuse via `git grep` |
| `local VAR=$(…)` in a `set -e` script | yes | silent-failure bash footgun |
| Broken Markdown links | yes | repo-relative link targets must resolve |
| CRLF/LF line endings | yes | per-extension policy |
| External linters | yes | py_compile, ruff, bash -n, eslint, tsc, radon, semgrep, gitleaks (each optional) |
| File too long | **warn only** | advisory nudge to split |

**Project-specific** policy is expressed as data-driven `[[rule]]` entries
(regex over added lines, with glob scoping and an allowlist) — never hard-coded.
See [`examples/web-project.toml`](examples/web-project.toml) for a worked config
(node project roots, `console.log` / `print()` rules with glob scoping).

## Install

```sh
cargo install --path .
# or build a release binary:
cargo build --release   # -> target/release/precommit-audit
```

## Adopting in a new project

The binary is project-agnostic — nothing about any one repo is baked in. To use
it in another project:

1. **Install the binary** once (`cargo install --path .`), so `precommit-audit`
   is on your `PATH`.
2. **(Optional) add a config.** Drop a `.precommit-audit.toml` at the repo root.
   With no config the generic checks still run; add config only to tune them or
   to declare project-specific `[[rule]]`s. Start from the documented template
   [`.precommit-audit.toml`](.precommit-audit.toml), or see
   [`examples/web-project.toml`](examples/web-project.toml) for a worked example.
3. **Wire it into a hook** — either the pre-commit framework or a raw git hook:

   ```sh
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit   (chmod +x)
   #!/bin/sh
   exec precommit-audit --mode precommit
   ```

   or the pre-commit-framework / Claude Code Stop forms shown under
   [Usage](#usage) below.
4. **Add project rules as you go.** Each new policy is a `[[rule]]` block (regex
   over added lines, with glob scoping and an allowlist) — you never touch the
   binary. Disable any built-in check you don't want under `[checks]`.

That's it: the same binary serves every repo; each repo's `.precommit-audit.toml`
carries its own policy.

## Usage

```sh
precommit-audit [--mode stop|precommit] [--config <file>] [--root <dir>]
precommit-audit trust   # trust <root> so its .precommit-audit.toml is honored
```

- `trust` — add the resolved `--root` to the shared workspace-trust list
  (`harness_core::trust`, the same list `donegate`/`reviewgate`/`tdd` use) so an
  auto-discovered `.precommit-audit.toml` is honored. Until trusted, a
  repo-shipped config is ignored (built-in checks still run on defaults).
- `--mode precommit` — for a pre-commit-framework / git hook on a human commit.
  Exits **1** on failure. Skips the (Claude Code) review contract.
- `--mode stop` (default) — for a Claude Code Stop hook. Honors the subagent
  review contract and exits **2** to feed findings back to the agent. Under a
  **SessionEnd** invocation it runs in **advisory** mode: blocking findings are
  still surfaced (printed prominently *and* recorded as a `block` in the audit
  log) but the exit code stays **0**, so the audit can never fail the session.
- `--config` — defaults to `<root>/.precommit-audit.toml`.
- `--root` — defaults to `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, else the git top-level.

Exit codes: `0` clean · `1` blocked (precommit) · `2` blocked (stop).

### As a pre-commit-framework hook

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: precommit-audit
      name: precommit-audit
      entry: precommit-audit --mode precommit
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
```

### As a Claude Code Stop hook

```json
{ "hooks": { "Stop": [ { "hooks": [
  { "command": "precommit-audit --mode stop", "timeout": 30 }
] } ] } }
```

## Configuration

Every knob lives in `.precommit-audit.toml`; all have built-in defaults, so the
file is optional. Start from the documented template
[`.precommit-audit.toml`](.precommit-audit.toml) in this repo.

### Suppression

- Per line: append `# audit-ignore: <reason>` (use `//` for JS/TS). A reason is
  **required** — a bare marker does not suppress.
- Per file: put `audit-ignore-file: <reason>` in the first 20 lines.
- One-shot bypass: create `<audit_dir>/.audit-skip` (consumed on read).

## Relation to the other Stop gates (donegate / reviewgate / tdd)

precommit-audit is **deliberately not** one of the JSON Stop-gates built on
`harness_core::gate`. Those three (donegate, reviewgate, tdd) are *Claude-only*
Stop hooks: they block by printing `{"decision":"block","reason":…}`. (Like
them, precommit-audit also gates project-local config behind
`harness_core::trust` — see **Trust gate** below — but it is not a JSON
Stop-gate.)

precommit-audit is a **dual-mode** hook and so keeps a different contract on
purpose:

- It runs both as a **git / pre-commit-framework hook on a human commit**
  (`precommit` mode, exit **1** on failure per pre-commit convention) and as a
  **Claude Code Stop hook** (`stop` mode, exit **2** to feed findings back), plus
  an advisory **SessionEnd** pass (exit **0**) that still surfaces and logs
  blocking findings but never fails the session. A git hook cannot speak
  Claude's JSON `decision:block` protocol, so the **exit-code + block-marker**
  contract is required, not an oversight. Its own `hookio` exists for the same
  dual-mode reason.
- It is therefore **excluded from the shared JSON-gate layer** — treat it as a
  sibling, not a fourth member of the trio.

**Trust gate.** Like the trio, precommit-audit now loads an auto-discovered
project `.precommit-audit.toml` only when the root is trusted
(`harness_core::trust`). The blast radius was always narrower than donegate's
(config only *toggles* hard-coded built-in linters and adds **regex** rules — it
can't name an arbitrary command), but `linters.node_projects` can resolve
repo-local `eslint`/`tsc` binaries, so a cloned untrusted repo was the one
execution vector. Now an untrusted repo's config is ignored (built-in checks
still run on defaults) with a one-shot stderr notice; trust the root with
`precommit-audit trust` (the shared list, so `donegate trust` / `tdd trust`
work too) to honor it. An explicit `--config <file>` is the operator's
deliberate choice and is always honored, trusted or not.

## Why a port

The original hook was PowerShell-only (Windows). This rewrite:

- runs natively on Linux/macOS/Windows as a single static binary,
- is UTF-8 throughout (no CP932 mojibake workarounds),
- separates generic checks (in the binary) from project policy (in TOML),
- ships with an integration test suite (`cargo test`).
