# trajectoryeval

A **trajectory-match verifier** — the sibling of an output verifier.

condukt's online verifier checks a task's **OUTPUT** (its `done_criteria`).
`trajectoryeval` checks the **PATH** the worker took to get there: the ordered
sequence of tool calls it made, against an *expected* trajectory spec. It is
inspired by the trajectory matchers in
[langchain-ai/agentevals](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals).

It is **subscription-native**: one bundled Rust binary, no API key, no network.

## Subcommands

### `trajectoryeval check --expected <spec.json> --actual <actual.json> [--json]`

Compares an actual ordered tool sequence against an expected spec and reports
`{ pass, missing, unexpected, out_of_order }` (human report, or `--json` for the
serialized result).

- **expected** spec JSON:
  ```json
  { "mode": "strict",
    "steps": [ { "tool": "Read" }, { "tool": "Edit", "optional": true } ] }
  ```
  `optional` defaults to `false`.
- **actual** JSON: an array of tool-name strings, e.g. `["Read", "Edit"]`
  (pipe the output of `extract` straight in).

### `trajectoryeval extract --transcript <jsonl>`

Streams a Claude Code transcript **line-by-line** (it never loads the whole
transcript into memory) and prints the ordered `tool_use` names as a JSON array
on stdout — ready to feed into `check --actual`.

## Modes

- **strict** — the actual sequence must equal the expected REQUIRED steps in
  order. Optional steps may be absent, but if present must sit in their slot.
  `missing` = required steps not matched; `unexpected` = actual tools with no
  place in the expected order; `out_of_order` = the right set appeared but in the
  wrong order.
- **unordered** — order is ignored. `missing` = required expected tools absent
  from actual (as a set); `unexpected` = actual tools not in the expected set;
  `out_of_order` is always false.
- **subsequence** — the required steps must appear in `actual` in order but not
  necessarily contiguously (other tools may interleave). `missing` = required
  steps not found as an in-order subsequence; extras are allowed, so `unexpected`
  stays empty; `out_of_order` is false.

In every mode: `pass = missing.is_empty() && unexpected.is_empty() && !out_of_order`.

## Exit codes

Mirrors the evalkit / schemaguard 0/1/2 gate policy:

| code | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | trajectory matched the spec (pass) |
| `1`  | a deviation (missing / unexpected / out-of-order steps) |
| `2`  | harness error (unreadable or unparseable input) |

This is a plain CLI **gate**, not a lifecycle hook.

## Example

```sh
trajectoryeval extract --transcript session.jsonl > actual.json
echo '{"mode":"strict","steps":[{"tool":"Read"},{"tool":"Edit"}]}' > spec.json
trajectoryeval check --expected spec.json --actual actual.json --json
```
