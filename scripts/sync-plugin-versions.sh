# Sync every plugin.json version to its crate's Cargo.toml version — the
# WRITE companion to check-versions.sh (which only *verifies* parity, read-only).
#
# The Cargo.toml [package] version is the source of truth; each
# .claude-plugin/plugin.json is rewritten to match. Run this after a tool bumps
# Cargo.toml (e.g. release-plz) so the distributed manifest (plugin.json) stays
# in lockstep and the version-parity gate (check-versions.sh) stays green.
#
# Idempotent: a crate already in sync is skipped with no file write, so running
# it repeatedly (or when nothing changed) is a clean no-op. A crate that is not
# BOTH a cargo crate and a plugin is skipped (same scope as check-versions.sh).
# Exit 0 always — this is a fix-up step, not a gate; use check-versions.sh to
# assert parity.
#
# Portable across GNU (CI/ubuntu) and BSD (macOS) userlands: the in-place edit
# uses awk match()/substr() rather than sed's non-portable `0,/re/` address, and
# replaces only the FIRST "version" line so nested "version" keys are untouched.
